Reviewthis readme (that's a pun, by the way)

Set your repo's Post-Receive hook to: http://reviewthis.heroku.com/

If a commit message includes the hash #reviewthis, any github user
(signified by @username) will get an email (if they have a public
email address). Also, any email address includes gets an email as
well.

Currently, sendmail is used in dev, and the heroku sendgrid addon
 is used in production.

TODO:
- parse every commit, not just the most recent
- HTML email template
- release!
